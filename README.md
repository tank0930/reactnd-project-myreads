* Start the development server with `npm start`
* The APP will automatically opened in your browser. If not, open the web browser and go to "http://localhost:3000/"

## How to use this application?
You can search new books by pressing the button located at the bottom right corner. You can add the new book to your book shelf by select an option from the drop down menu at the bottom right corner of the book. 

## Search Terms from Udacity
"The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results."
